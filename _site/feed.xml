        <title>O papel do Weed na força punitiva</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The punitive force bound for Village Baran!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Located on the borderline of human civilization, Rosenheim Kingdom was surrounded by monsters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The kingdom fortified the walls and organized militias in frontier towns, but the annual feasts by goblins and Orcs that raided to pillage autumn harvests were still rampant, which gave the royal court a headache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mission of the punitive force assigned to Darius was a group quest to take over Village Baran that had fallen into the hands of the lizardmen. Those who joined the punitive force shared the same quest, and they, composed of three hundred users, would...</description>

        <title>A cidade do céu</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A pub. A place that is usually filled with hearty laughter and clamorous noises had been silent for the last few days all because of a single man, Volk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He had a scarily massive body, but what was scarier was his face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering that someone whose countenance could make even an Orc’s heart skip a few beats, had been drinking gloomily all day long, it was hardly surprising that the pub was drowned in silence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volk made a terrifying face while drinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘I want to propose to her. But I need something special for her, if there is anything.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volk...</description>

        <title>A profissão Predestinada</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As was his routine, Rodriguez was taking an afternoon walk. He enjoyed checking on his neighbors and deepening their misery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How are you, Hans?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fine, Counselor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What is the best fruit today?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This one. Please have some. Fresh strawberry, sire.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rodriguez’s steps were light. For one thing, he wasn’t pestering others who fell under his gaze that afternoon. He was elated by the recent publication of the latest book he had penned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he returned home, his manservant in care of the manor was waiting at the entrance to greet him. He spoke without reservation to the manservant...</description>

        <title>o Maesto das Batalhas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lair of Litvart was at the entrance of Grave Mountains, a three hours trip on horseback from the Citadel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The colt Weed was riding on occasionally diverted off course, and even chewed on grass leisurely. He had to cajole it to stay on course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In front of the lair, a soldier who would look after the horses was waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Johnson, take good care of the horses.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The punitive force led by Sir Midvale left their horses to the soldier, and entered the lair. Weed was finally relieved of the colt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ready for battle!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Set in...</description>

        <title>Sobre o churrasco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez was afflicted by a serious disturbance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the sixth day, and that fellow called Weed was still sitting down right across from the manor. Rodriguez in his seclusion had been aware of the presence of the intruder right from the first day. Rodriquez bet that Weed was busy selling his silly little statues to customers still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I need to figure out this man and what he wants from me.” Rodriguez muttered to himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of his extreme laziness, on the sixth day Rodriguez finally gave in to his curiosity and moved his butt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Greetings, stranger. I...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Damn… it’s day again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, Lee Hyun was already deflated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The South Korean Parliament in their infinite wisdom, have passed an unwanted bill nicknamed ‘Leave No One Behind’, which was devised to weed out anti-social outcasts and misfits from Korean society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This whole stupidity was founded on the theory that insisted that those who were born and brought up with defective backgrounds created a higher risk of people committing violent crimes and filing for divorces. e.g. Those families with no parents and had massive debts to pay off to loan sharks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the law, all Korean...</description>

        <title>O terrível Weed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The civilization of the Versailles Continent dawned approximately one million and eight thousand years ago. Back then, Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Orcs lived together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dwarf women with deft hands served as midwives to baby Orcs. Orcs in infancy were christened by elven women, and human women bathed them clean in water. The four races had lived together, each compensating for what the others were missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The elf rangers gathered fruit from trees, the dwarf crafters made tools, and human scouts hunted game along with the Orc warriors. As deadly monsters abound in the world, the weak had no choice but...</description>

        <title>O pedido do Instrutor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Weed primeiro caminhou até a fonte e encheu o seu cantil com água e, em seguida, seguiu até a loja de esculturas. Esse era o primeiro passeio de Weed pelas ruas da cidadela, a qual estava cheia de usuários e NPCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nós precisamos de um clérigo de nível 17 ou acima!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ei pessoal! Nós estamos indo para uma incursão na Caverna Lasok. Alguém quer se juntar a nós?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Muitos usuários estavam nas ruas, mas nenhum deles sequer deu uma olhada para Weed, ainda que ele não se importasse com isso. Caminhando ao redor apenas com as roupas de...</description>

Era um espaço dentro do universo. Então ele percebeu que estava no meio do processo de ativação de uma nova conta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sim!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div...</description>

        <title>O Nascimento de um Dark Gamer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apenas imagine uma nobre, elegante e pitoresca vida de pobreza que você encontra em uma novela, e não importa o quão pobre você fosse, isso ainda não lhe desencoraja a mostrar amor incondicional para estranhos ou mesmo dividir seu pedaço de pão com um sorriso caloroso.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Se alguem alegasse que tal ilusão existisse na realidade, Lee Hyun os espancaria até virar uma polpa e bateria neles novamente para finaliza-los.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vida é realmente muito cruel com os pobres. A Lei do Bem-Estar do Trabalho revisada pelo parlamento tornou todos os empregos indisponíveis para os menores e, embora fosse ilegal, Lee...</description>
